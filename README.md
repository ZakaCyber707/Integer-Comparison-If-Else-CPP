# Integer Comparison (if-else statement)

## 📖 Project Overview
This repository focuses on **Conditional Logic** in C++. It provides a clear example of how to use relational operators to compare two variables and output the result based on their relationship.

## ⚙️ How the Logic Works
The program processes input through three specific branches:
* **Branch 1 (if):** Checks if the first number is greater than the second (`a > b`).
* **Branch 2 (else if):** If the first condition is false, it checks if the first number is smaller (`a < b`).
* **Branch 3 (else):** If both above are false, it concludes the numbers are equal.



## 🛠️ Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile the source: `g++ ComparisonLogic.cpp -o Compare`
3. Execute the program: `./Compare`
